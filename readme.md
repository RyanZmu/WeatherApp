**Purpose of Project**

- Grab a users geolocation (use geolocation API) and display the current weather,the 5 or 7 day forecast with as much details as possible and use pictures to visualize the weather.

**Planning**

- Use geolocation API to get informaton on the users location, feed that to the NWS API. Figure out how the API works and feed it the LAT and LONG.

- Display a picure based on the users current weather (sunny,cloudy,rainy,etc) while also having an appropiate picture of the weather in the background (if rainy have a background of a city being rain on while also displaying a smaller photo of the weather where we have our forecast)

- Research some more free APIs that could enhance the users experience, possibly allow a radar/doppler.

- When the user sees their current weather they should also see their forecast right below (reference drawings) and from there they can click and if the API allows it, they'll see details for that days forecast.

- Make this site mobile friendly also possibly recreate this with React as we get more into that course.
